## Overview

Pharmaceutical drugs play a critical role in maintaining public health. However, their safety must be rigorously validated. This project uses Python to conduct statistical hypothesis tests on a clinical dataset to determine if the **adverse reactions** to a hypothetical drug differ significantly from those of a **placebo**.

The dataset, `drug_safety.csv`, sourced from **Hbiostat** (Vanderbilt University Department of Biostatistics), contains patient demographics, vital signs, and the presence and number of adverse effects. It includes both **Drug** and **Placebo** groups in a **2:1 ratio**.

## Technologies & Tools Used

- **Python** – For data manipulation and analysis  
- **Pandas, NumPy** – For handling and preparing data  
- **Statsmodels, Pingouin** – For hypothesis testing  
- **Seaborn, Matplotlib** – For data visualization  
- **Jupyter Notebook** – For exploratory analysis and narrative

## Project Goals

- **Evaluate Proportions** – Determine if the proportion of adverse effects differs between Drug and Placebo  
- **Test Independence** – Assess if the number of effects is independent of the treatment group  
- **Compare Distributions** – Investigate if age significantly differs between the two groups

## Business Impact

1. **Drug Safety Verification**: Validates whether adverse reactions are statistically different and supports go/no-go decisions in clinical trials.

2. **Demographic Risk Assessment**: Identifies whether specific groups (like older individuals) are more vulnerable to side effects.

3. **Regulatory Confidence**: Provides robust statistical evidence for reports submitted to regulatory bodies (e.g., FDA).

4. **Clinical Insight**: Helps pharmaceutical researchers design better trials and understand treatment group dynamics based on evidence.
