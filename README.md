# Hypothesis-Testing-in-Healthcare
Python Statistical HealthCare Data Analysis

##### Pharmaceutical drugs have become an essential part of our health. Therefore, they need to be safe with little or no adverse effects..We will conduct several hypothesis tests using Python to determine if the adverse reactions of a hypothetical drug are significant and also check if factors such as age significantly influence the adverse reactions.

##### The dataset provided contained five adverse effects, demographic data, vital signs, etc.The dataset drug_safety.csv was obtained from Hbiostat courtesy of the Vanderbilt University Department of Biostatistics. It contained five adverse effects: headache, abdominal pain, dyspepsia, upper respiratory infection, chronic obstructive airway disease (COAD), demographic data, vital signs, lab measures, etc. The ratio of drug observations to placebo observations is 2 to 1.For this project, the dataset has been modified to reflect the presence and absence of adverse effects adverse_effects and the number of adverse effects in a single individual num_effects.
